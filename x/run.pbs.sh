# For example, you can have this script resubmit itself.
# Or, if you have a script for populating the todo/priority folders, you can run it now.

# ATTACK THE QUEUE
source ${METAQ}/x/launch.sh     # ANYTHING BELOW HERE IS NOT GUARANTEED TO RUN!
                                # For example, if the tasks run out the wall clock time, x/launch.sh never finishes.

# AND THAT IS ALL!
